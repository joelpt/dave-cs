CS Course for Dave

# Overview

This is a CS course being customized for Dave. The current overarching plan is for Dave to attain job-readiness for an entry level professional software developer role in 3 years or less. The target workload is 30 hrs/week.

High level overview of what will be covered:

* Basic computer science (how computers work, binary, networking, etc.) with a bit of C
* Basic algorithms and data structures
* Linear algebra
* Unix shell
* Python
* Java including OO design
* Javascript/HTML/CSS
* Node.js + Express
* Mobile-ready web app design
* Deep dives into developer best practices
* Use of key developer tools: Git, IDEs and text editors, debugging tools, JIRA, etc.
* Completion of 2-3 major, portfolio-worthy projects

The core goal is to get a front-end web developer job at the end of the training period. Dave should also be educated enough to understand full stack web development and work through it.

# Rules

## Take notes

To begin, acquire a pen and a notebook. Use these to take notes about the videos and texts you read during the course. This is intended to develop the habit of taking notes: you can vary this later (e.g. take notes on a computer, voice memos, ...) but for now, begin taking notes as a matter of course.

## References, not plagiarism

Plagiarism is not allowed for writing tasks, however you can and should use Google to look up answers to ANY part throughout the training, and sometimes you will be expected to do so. An important skill in the developer's tool belt is being able to find answers on their own and self-educate themselves to solve unknowns.

In writing, include references (URLs) to sources when appropriate.

# Blocks

The plan is structured in blocks. Each block consists of one or more "tracks" of lessons or projects that will be completed in parallel. When one block is completed we'll move to the next block.

This is a living document. Future planned blocks can and probably will change as we see how things unfold.
